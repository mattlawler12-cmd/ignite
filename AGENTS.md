# AGENTS.md

Operating notes for LLM agents working in this repo. Read this first.

## 1. What this repo is

WordPress theme for **igniteiq.com**, ported from Claude Design HTML/JS/CSS exports. This repo is the canonical source of truth — the theme code lives in `igniteiq/`, with the repo root holding deploy tooling and runbooks. There are two deploy paths: **Local by Flywheel** for visual dev, and **WP Engine staging** via a GitHub Action on push to `main`. Production is not automated.

## Fidelity invariant

The WP build on staging must exactly match the latest export's content and visuals. A push to `main` is a claim of fidelity.

- **Content:** every headline, body string, button label, footer link, and array of cards/items in `exports/latest/` must appear verbatim on the rendered page.
- **Visuals:** colors (hex), spacing tokens, typography, component order, image src URLs, and CSS class composition must match.
- **Audit trail:** the byte-accurate output of `/diff-iiq-export` is the checklist. Don't push until every item from its "Fidelity checklist" section is reflected in `template-parts/*.php` markup AND the matching row in `inc/cli.php` `default_pages()`.
- **Verification:** after the deploy goes green, run `/verify-iiq-fidelity` (scrapes the 6 staging URLs, greps for every string from `exports/latest/`, reports anything missing). Don't consider the port done until that report is clean.

If a delta in the export is intentionally not being ported (rare — discuss with Matt first), document it in a `// FIDELITY EXCEPTION:` comment in the relevant `template-parts/*.php` file.

## 2. Theme directory layout

```

Repo root (outside `igniteiq/`):

```
deploy.sh                       - rsync to Local Sites theme dir
README.md / MIGRATE.md          - human runbooks
.github/workflows/
  deploy-staging.yml            - WPE staging deploy on push to main
exports/                        - gitignored Claude Design export workspace
  README.md / .gitkeep
```

## 3. ACF flexible-content pattern (load-bearing)

This is the spine of the site. Internalize it before editing.

- Each of the **6 cornerstone pages** (`home`, `how-it-works`, `ontology`, `company`, `contact`, `signin`) has an ACF flexible-content field named `page_sections`.
- The 15 layouts are registered in `igniteiq/inc/acf-field-groups.php`: 5 heroes + 6 section types (pillars, split, stats, stack, prose, team) + trust-logos + trust-quote + cta-banner + diagram + form.
- Each layout's PHP renderer lives at `igniteiq/template-parts/{heroes,sections,diagrams,forms}/<name>.php`.
- `igniteiq/inc/acf-render-flexible.php` is the loop that walks `page_sections` and dispatches to each renderer in order. Page templates (`front-page.php`, `page-*.php`) call into this — `the_content()` is bypassed.
- **Default content** for each page is seeded by `IgniteIQ_CLI::default_pages()` in `igniteiq/inc/cli.php`, keyed by page slug. The class is defined unconditionally so non-CLI callers (e.g. the deprecated admin tool) can read the defaults.
- To add or change copy on a cornerstone page: edit the renderer (PHP markup) **and** the matching seed row (PHP array in `default_pages()`) in lockstep. Markup-only changes leave the DB stale; seed-only changes have no place to render.
- Site-wide content (footer columns, contact email, social links) lives in the ACF options page registered by `inc/acf-options-page.php` ("Site Settings" in the admin sidebar), not in `page_sections`.

## 4. Two deploy paths

**Local visual dev** (manual, fast iteration):
- `bash deploy.sh` from repo root.
- rsyncs `igniteiq/` → `~/Local Sites/igniteiq/app/public/wp-content/themes/igniteiq-v2/` (with `--delete`, excluding `.git`, `.DS_Store`, `node_modules`, `deploy.sh`).
- Visit `http://igniteiq.local/`. ACF Pro must be installed in the Local site. Seed via `wp igniteiq seed --force` from Local's site shell when copy changes.

**WP Engine staging** (automated, on push to `main`):
- Triggered by `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` (also `workflow_dispatch`).
- Steps: load `WPE_SSH_KEY` secret → rsync `igniteiq/` → `igniteiqstg@igniteiqstg.ssh.wpengine.net:sites/igniteiqstg/wp-content/themes/igniteiq-v2/` (excluding `.git`, `*.bak*`, `node_modules`, `exports/`) → SSH in and run `wp igniteiq seed --force` → curl-verify the 6 cornerstone URLs return 200.
- Watch deploys at the GitHub Actions tab. Live preview at `https://igniteiqstg.wpenginepowered.com/`.
- Concurrency group `deploy-staging` prevents overlapping runs; new pushes queue rather than cancel.

**Production** is not automated. Pushing to `main` does **not** touch production. Production deploy is a separate manual step (out of scope for this repo).

## 5. Export-drop convention

See `exports/README.md` for full details. Two paths:

**Cloud inbox (shared with Scott — preferred):**
- Drop the zip into `~/Google Drive/My Drive/IgniteIQ/Claude Design Exports/`.
- A `launchd` agent on Matt's Mac (`~/scripts/igniteiq/watch-exports.sh`, plist at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.igniteiq.export-watcher.plist`) watches the folder, validates the zip (≤500MB, no path-traversal, no symlinks), unzips into `exports/<YYYYMMDD>-<derived-name>/`, repoints `exports/latest`, pre-generates `DIFF.md` (export-vs-staging string diff), and fires an actionable macOS dialog (Cancel / View diff / Open in Claude Code).
- Requires Full Disk Access granted to `/bin/bash` (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access). Without it, the watcher can't read Google Drive contents from a launchd context. See `scripts/README.md` for setup.

**Manual (offline / fallback):**
- Unzip into `exports/<YYYYMMDD>-<short-name>/` (e.g. `exports/20260501-pricing-update/`). Either Claude Design layout works — the export's content root may be `site/` or `igniteiq-website/project/`.
- Update the `latest` symlink: `cd exports && ln -snf <YYYYMMDD>-<short-name> latest`.

Everything under `exports/` is gitignored except `.gitkeep` and `README.md`. Never commit unzipped contents or zips.

## 6. Port process (the loop)

1. Export drops in the shared cloud inbox (`~/Google Drive/My Drive/IgniteIQ/Claude Design Exports/`). The `launchd` watcher unzips + repoints `latest`, then pre-generates `exports/<dated>/DIFF.md` (the porting backlog: strings missing on staging vs. the export, computed via `iiq-extract.py` + `curl` of the 6 cornerstone URLs). An `osascript display dialog` fires with three buttons: **Cancel** / **View diff** (opens `DIFF.md`) / **Open in Claude Code** (copies `/port-iiq-diff` to the clipboard, opens Terminal in the repo).
2. In the opened Terminal, run `claude`, then paste (⌘V) the pre-loaded `/port-iiq-diff` slash command. The skill (at `~/.claude/skills/port-iiq-diff/`) reads `exports/latest/DIFF.md`, edits `igniteiq/inc/cli.php` `default_pages()` rows + matching `igniteiq/template-parts/*.php` markup byte-accurately to land every missing string, then runs `php -l` on every modified file and prints a summary. The skill does NOT commit or push.
3. Edit the listed `igniteiq/template-parts/*.php` files (markup) **and** the matching rows in `igniteiq/inc/cli.php` `default_pages()` (seeded copy). Keep them in sync. `/port-iiq-diff` does most of this; spot-check anything it flagged "Unmapped".
4. `bash deploy.sh` to mirror to Local. Preview at `http://igniteiq.local/`. Reseed in Local's site shell if copy changed: `wp igniteiq seed --force`.
5. Commit + push to `main`. The Action deploys to WPE staging and reseeds automatically.
6. Run `/verify-iiq-fidelity` to confirm every export string is now on staging. Don't consider the port done until that report is clean.

If you need a fresh diff outside the dialog flow (e.g. you ran the skill, made manual fixes, and want to see what's still missing), `/diff-iiq-export` (skill at `~/.claude/skills/diff-iiq-export/`) regenerates the same kind of comparison on demand. The watcher's `DIFF.md` is the same data, just pre-baked at unzip time.

## 7. Cowork plugin (multi-user port)

The IgniteIQ port workflow can also run inside an Anthropic Cowork project, so
either Matt or Scott can drop a Claude Design handoff URL into a chat and the
port runs end-to-end without touching anyone's local launchd watcher.

- Plugin source: `cowork-plugin/igniteiq-port/`
- Built artifact: `cowork-plugin/igniteiq-port.plugin` (run `bash scripts/build-cowork-plugin.sh` to rebuild)
- Bundled skills: fetch-iiq-design, diff-iiq-export, port-iiq-diff,
  verify-iiq-fidelity, visual-iiq-diff
- Connectors required: GitHub (Cowork's built-in connector — push access to `mattlawler12-cmd/ignite`)

Install: drag-drop `igniteiq-port.plugin` into the Cowork desktop app inside
the shared "IgniteIQ Website" project. See `cowork-plugin/igniteiq-port/README.md`
for onboarding details.

The local launchd watcher (`scripts/watch-exports.sh`) remains for Matt's
solo workflow when he just wants to drop a zip into Google Drive instead.
The two paths produce the same `exports/<dated>/` structure and are
interchangeable downstream.

## 8. Don'ts

- Don't add new code to `igniteiq/inc/admin-seed-tool.php`. It's a temporary bridge for staging without SSH/WP-CLI and is being removed once staging is happy. Use WP-CLI (`wp igniteiq seed`) or the GitHub Action seed step instead.
- Don't bypass `IgniteIQ_CLI::default_pages()` in `igniteiq/inc/cli.php` for seed copy. It's the single source of truth, paired with `template-parts/` markup. Don't hardcode copy in renderers as fallbacks for missing seed data.
- Don't edit ACF field groups in WP Admin — they're PHP-registered in `inc/acf-field-groups.php` (no `acf-json/` sync), so admin edits are non-persistent and lost on next deploy.
- Don't edit theme files inside `~/Local Sites/.../themes/igniteiq-v2/` directly. That directory is a runtime mirror and is overwritten by the next `bash deploy.sh`. Edit here, then deploy.
- Don't commit anything under `exports/` (it's gitignored, but be aware — large unzipped trees should never make it into git).
- Don't deploy to production from this repo. Staging only. Production is a separate manual flow.
- Don't skip the seed step after pushing copy changes — the Action handles WPE staging, but Local needs `wp igniteiq seed --force` run by hand from the site shell.
