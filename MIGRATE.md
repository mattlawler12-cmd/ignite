# IgniteIQ v2 — Activation & Migration Runbook

This is a one-time runbook to switch from the existing v1 theme to v2.

## 0. Prerequisites

- Local by Flywheel site `igniteiq` running at `http://igniteiq.local/`
- ACF Pro plugin installed and activated
- `bash deploy.sh` has been run from this directory (syncs `igniteiq/` → Local's themes folder as `igniteiq-v2/`)

## 1. Activate v2

1. Open WP Admin → Appearance → Themes
2. Activate **IgniteIQ v2**
3. The existing `igniteiq` (v1) stays installed — you can revert at any time

## 2. WP-CLI migration (recommended)

Open Local → right-click the `igniteiq` site → "Open site shell". Then:

```bash
# Find Architecture page
ARCH_ID=$(wp post list --post_type=page --name=architecture --field=ID)
echo "Architecture page ID: $ARCH_ID"

# Rename Architecture → How it works (preserves the page row)
wp post update $ARCH_ID --post_title="How it works" --post_name="how-it-works"

# Create Contact + Sign in
wp post create --post_type=page --post_status=publish --post_title="Contact" --post_name="contact"
wp post create --post_type=page --post_status=publish --post_title="Sign in" --post_name="signin"

# Set "Home" as the static front page (if not already)
HOME_ID=$(wp post list --post_type=page --name=home --field=ID)
[ -n "$HOME_ID" ] && wp option update show_on_front page && wp option update page_on_front $HOME_ID

# Update Primary menu — replace "Architecture" entry pointing at renamed page
for ID in $(wp menu item list primary --format=ids); do
  TITLE=$(wp post get $ID --field=post_title 2>/dev/null)
  if [ "$TITLE" = "Architecture" ]; then
    wp menu item delete $ID
  fi
done
wp menu item add-post primary $ARCH_ID --title="How it works"

# Flush rewrite rules so /how-it-works/, /contact/, /signin/ resolve
wp rewrite flush --hard

# Seed pages with default flexible-content (idempotent — skips populated pages)
wp igniteiq seed
# Or to overwrite existing data with the JSX defaults:
# wp igniteiq seed --force
```

## 3. Admin UI seed tool (for staging without SSH/WP-CLI)

When SSH/WP-CLI isn't available (e.g. WP Engine staging), use the bundled admin tool:

1. WP Admin → **Tools → IgniteIQ Migrate**
2. Click **Run migration + seed**

This will:
- Create any of the six cornerstone pages that don't yet exist (`home`, `how-it-works`, `ontology`, `company`, `contact`, `signin`)
- Set **Home** as the static front page
- Seed each page's `page_sections` from `inc/cli.php` defaults (skips pages that already have content)

Tick **Force overwrite** to replace existing `page_sections` with the JSX defaults — use this when applying updated seed content from the theme.

The admin tool does **not** rename an existing v1 "Architecture" page or rebuild the Primary menu — for that, use the WP-CLI path in section 2. On a clean staging install with no v1 content, the admin tool is sufficient on its own.

After staging is happy, delete `inc/admin-seed-tool.php` and remove the matching `require_once` block in `functions.php` (see the comment in that file).

## 4. UI equivalent (manual click-path)

If neither WP-CLI nor the admin seed tool fits:

1. **Pages → Architecture → Quick Edit**
   - Title: `How it works`
   - Slug: `how-it-works`
   - Update
2. **Pages → Add New** twice — create:
   - "Contact" (slug `contact`)
   - "Sign in" (slug `signin`)
3. **Settings → Reading**: ensure "A static page" is selected, with "Home" as front page
4. **Appearance → Menus → Primary**:
   - Remove the "Architecture" item
   - Add the renamed page (now titled "How it works") to the menu
5. **Settings → Permalinks → Save Changes** (no edits needed — just press Save to flush rewrites)
6. Edit each page in WP Admin and fill in the ACF Page Sections fields. Or run `wp igniteiq seed` from Local's site shell to populate defaults.

## 5. Verification

```bash
# In Local site shell:
for url in / /how-it-works/ /ontology/ /company/ /contact/ /signin/; do
  echo -n "$url -> "
  curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code}\n" "http://igniteiq.local${url}"
done
```

All should return `200`. Old slug `/architecture/` should auto-301 to `/how-it-works/` via WP's `wp_old_slug_redirect`.

Visual checks:
- Home: hero, all numbered sections, footer render
- Mobile (DevTools at 859px): burger appears, opens drawer, ESC closes, scroll locked while open
- Contact form: fill required fields, submit, see success state. Check Local's Mailpit/Mailhog tab for the outbound email.
- Honeypot: in DevTools, find the hidden `<input name="website">`, fill it, submit — request silently accepted with no email sent.
- Console: no errors on any page

## 6. Editing copy

In WP Admin → edit any of the 6 pages. The page editor is **disabled** for these pages (the_content() is bypassed). Instead, scroll to the **Page Sections** ACF flexible-content field and edit the layouts there.

Layouts available (15 total):
- 5 hero variants — statement, editorial, cinematic, split, minimal
- 6 section types — pillars, split, stats, stack, prose, team
- 3 trust + CTA — trust-logos, trust-quote, cta-banner
- 2 utility — diagram, form

Site-wide content (footer columns, contact email, social links) lives in **Site Settings** in the admin sidebar.

## 7. Reverting

If anything breaks: WP Admin → Appearance → Themes → activate `igniteiq` (v1). The v1 theme is still installed.
