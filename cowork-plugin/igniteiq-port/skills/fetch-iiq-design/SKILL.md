name: fetch-iiq-design
description: Fetch a Claude Design handoff URL and unpack it into exports/<dated>/ ready for porting. Replaces the zip-drop step in the IgniteIQ port loop. Use when the user pastes a `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/design/h/...` URL or asks to "implement this design". Triggers on the URL pattern, "fetch design", "handoff url", "implement design", "/fetch-iiq-design". Pre-generates DIFF.md so /port-iiq-diff can run immediately after. READ-ONLY for the repo (writes only into exports/, which is gitignored).

# fetch-iiq-design

## What this skill does

Given a Claude Design handoff URL (or just the handoff ID), fetches the public tarball, extracts it into a fresh `~/Desktop/igniteiq-theme-v2/exports/<dated>-handoff-<id>/`, repoints the `latest` symlink, and pre-generates `DIFF.md` (export-vs-staging string diff) using the same logic as the legacy `watch-exports.sh` zip-drop watcher. Output is a one-line summary plus the suggested next step (`/port-iiq-diff`).

This is the URL-based replacement for the "zip → cloud inbox → watcher" path. The downstream skills (`/diff-iiq-export`, `/port-iiq-diff`, `/verify-iiq-fidelity`, `/visual-iiq-diff`) consume the resulting `exports/latest/` unchanged.

## Inputs

`/fetch-iiq-design <url-or-id> [short-name]`

Accepted forms for arg 1:
- Full URL with query: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/design/h/Qc-gT_rMrYCXrKv8IkiznA?open_file=index.html`
- Full URL no query:   `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/design/h/Qc-gT_rMrYCXrKv8IkiznA`
- Bare handoff ID:     `Qc-gT_rMrYCXrKv8IkiznA` (skill prepends the URL)

Optional arg 2: a short-name for the dated directory (kebab-case). If omitted, derived from the first 8 chars of the handoff ID, lowercased, with non-alphanumeric chars replaced by `-`.

If neither arg is provided, stop and ask the user for the URL.

## Algorithm

```bash
INPUT="$1"          # url or id
SHORT_NAME="$2"     # optional override

EXPORTS=~/Desktop/igniteiq-theme-v2/exports
mkdir -p "$EXPORTS"

# 1. Extract handoff ID from URL or accept bare ID
ID=$(printf '%s' "$INPUT" | sed -E 's|.*/design/h/([^/?#]+).*|\1|')
# Validate: handoff IDs are URL-safe base64-ish, ~22 chars
if ! printf '%s' "$ID" | grep -qE '^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,64}$'; then
  echo "Error: could not extract handoff ID from '$INPUT'." >&2

# 4. Validate it's actually a gzipped tarball, not an error JSON

## Output format

Six concise lines (or fewer on early failure). Example:

```
$ /fetch-iiq-design https://api.anthropic.com/v1/design/h/Qc-gT_rMrYCXrKv8IkiznA?open_file=index.html
Fetching design Qc-gT_rMrYCXrKv8IkiznA...
Downloaded 2.0 MB tarball
Extracted 47 files into exports/20260501-handoff-qcgt_rmr/
Pointed exports/latest -> 20260501-handoff-qcgt_rmr
Generated DIFF.md (152 missing on staging, 142 extras)

Next: /port-iiq-diff
```

## Failure modes

- **Bad input** (no URL, mangled URL): clear error pointing at expected forms. No partial dir created.
- **Network failure on curl** (`curl` non-zero exit, or HTTP_CODE != 200): report the HTTP code and a snippet of the body if small. No partial dir.
- **Non-tarball response** (e.g. `not found` text body, error JSON): detected via `file` before any extraction. Reports the actual content type and the body snippet. No partial dir.
- **Tar extract fails** (corrupt archive): reports the failure and removes the empty target dir.
- **Missing `index.html`** in extracted tree: extraction succeeded but the export shape is unfamiliar — print a warning and skip DIFF.md generation. Symlink is still repointed; user can run `/diff-iiq-export` manually after inspecting.
- **`iiq-extract.py` missing** at `~/scripts/igniteiq/iiq-extract.py`: report and skip DIFF.md generation. Don't fail the whole skill — extraction itself is the important part.
- **Staging unreachable** while generating DIFF.md: `curl` returns empty, the staging-strings file is empty, every export string shows as "missing". This is loud but not silent — the user will notice on the next step.

## Security note

These handoff URLs come from a third party (Scott or whoever shared the design). The skill:
- Only writes inside `~/Desktop/igniteiq-theme-v2/exports/`, which is gitignored.
- Validates the response is a gzipped tarball **before** extracting (via `file`).
- Uses `tar -xzf` (no `-p`, no `--same-owner`); macOS BSD tar refuses absolute paths and `..` traversal entries by default.
- Does **not** execute, source, or eval any code from the export.
- Does not chmod or run anything from the extracted tree.

If this skill ever needs to handle untrusted URLs at scale, add explicit MAX_BYTES + path-traversal guards mirroring `watch-exports.sh`. For the current human-driven workflow (Matt pastes a URL Scott sent him), the gzip + non-executable extraction is sufficient.

## Don'ts

- Don't run a port. Stop after DIFF.md. The user runs `/port-iiq-diff` next.
- Don't write outside `exports/`. No edits to PHP, no commits.
- Don't auto-overwrite an existing dated dir. Append `-HHMMSS` instead.
- Don't follow `?open_file=...` query params or any other URL behavior beyond GET. The handoff endpoint returns the same tarball regardless of query string.
