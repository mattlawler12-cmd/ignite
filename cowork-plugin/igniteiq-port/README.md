# IgniteIQ Port — Cowork plugin

End-to-end Claude Design → WordPress port loop, packaged for the Cowork desktop
app. Drop a Claude Design handoff URL (or attached zip) into a Cowork chat in
the shared **IgniteIQ Website** project; Claude routes through the bundled
skills to fetch the export, diff it against live staging, edit the WP theme
byte-accurately, lint with `php -l`, and stop just before push. You review
the diff and push to `main`. The repo's GitHub Action takes it from there to
WP Engine staging.

This plugin is the multi-user port path. Matt's solo `launchd` watcher
(`scripts/watch-exports.sh` in the repo root) still works for drag-and-drop
into Google Drive. The two paths produce the same `exports/<dated>/` structure
and are interchangeable downstream.

## What's bundled

Five user-scoped skills, all routed via `/<name>`:

- `/fetch-iiq-design` — fetch a Claude Design handoff URL (or ID) into a
  fresh `exports/<dated>-handoff-<id>/`, repoint `exports/latest`, and
  pre-generate `DIFF.md`
- `/diff-iiq-export` — diff `exports/latest/` against live staging and emit a
  porting checklist with WP theme mapping
- `/port-iiq-diff` — edit `cli.php` seed rows + `template-parts/*.php` markup
  to land every "missing on staging" string from the diff; runs `php -l`
- `/verify-iiq-fidelity` — confirm every export string is present on live
  staging (post-deploy fidelity audit)
- `/visual-iiq-diff` — screenshot-based per-page visual gap report
  (export `file://` vs. `https://igniteiqstg.wpenginepowered.com`)

Plus one bundled MCP server:

- **Playwright MCP** (Microsoft, `@playwright/mcp`) — bundled via `.mcp.json`,
  starts via `npx` on first plugin load. Exposes `navigate`, `screenshot`,
  `get_html`, `click`, `wait_for_selector`, etc. as Claude tools. Runs on the
  Mac (not in the Cowork sandbox), so it can hit
  `https://igniteiqstg.wpenginepowered.com` directly. This is what unblocks
  visual fidelity checks from inside a Cowork chat — without it, the sandbox
  blocks all non-Anthropic outbound and visual diffs require a Mac-local
  round-trip. First load downloads the MCP package via `npx -y` (no manual
  install). The `/visual-iiq-diff` skill still works the old way (Playwright
  via `node scripts/iiq-shoot.js`); the MCP is an additional surface for
  ad-hoc per-page checks Claude can drive directly.

## Install

1. Build the artifact from the repo root:
   ```
   bash scripts/build-cowork-plugin.sh
   ```
   This produces `cowork-plugin/igniteiq-port.plugin`.
2. Open the Cowork desktop app and select the **IgniteIQ Website** project.
3. Drag-drop `igniteiq-port.plugin` onto the chat (or use Cowork's plugin
   install command from the project settings menu — confirm exact path in the
   Cowork docs).

## Connect GitHub (first run)

The skills push edits using whatever GitHub auth Cowork provides. Two
equivalent paths:

- **GitHub MCP (recommended)** — Cowork → Settings → Connectors → add
  GitHub's official MCP server. This gives Claude ~40 specific GitHub tools
  (`create_or_update_file`, `push_files`, `create_pull_request`, etc.) for
  fine-grained API operations.
- **OAuth connector** — Cowork → Settings → Connectors → GitHub → Connect.
  Generic auth that the local `git` CLI uses for `git push`.

Either works; the skills will use whichever is available. Whichever you
pick, ensure the auth has push access to `mattlawler12-cmd/ignite`.

Verify the connector shows green before running `/port-iiq-diff`.

## Use

**Handoff URL flow (preferred):**

1. Paste a Claude Design handoff URL into a Cowork chat in the IgniteIQ
   Website project.
2. Claude routes to `/fetch-iiq-design` (downloads the export, unzips into
   `exports/<YYYYMMDD>-<derived-name>/`, repoints `exports/latest`).
3. Claude then runs `/diff-iiq-export` (writes `exports/latest/DIFF.md`)
   and `/port-iiq-diff` (edits `cli.php` + `template-parts/*.php`).
4. Review the diff. When happy, ask Claude to commit + push to `main`. The
   repo's GitHub Action deploys to WPE staging and reseeds.
5. Run `/verify-iiq-fidelity` and `/visual-iiq-diff` to confirm fidelity.

**Attached zip flow:**

Same loop, but skip step 2 — drop the zip into the chat and Claude runs
`/diff-iiq-export` directly against it. *TODO: confirm Cowork's exact
attachment-handling path; the zip needs to land at
`exports/<dated>/` before `/diff-iiq-export` can read it.*

## Don'ts

- **Don't push to production from this plugin.** Staging only. Production is
  a separate manual flow handled outside this repo.
- **Don't bypass the diff.** Always let `/diff-iiq-export` (or the watcher's
  pre-baked `DIFF.md`) drive the port. Manual edits without the diff break
  the fidelity invariant.
- **Don't run `/port-iiq-diff` against `main` without a fresh `exports/latest/`.**
  The skill assumes a current export is on disk.

the Cowork session ID, the handoff URL (if applicable), and the relevant
section of `exports/latest/DIFF.md`.
